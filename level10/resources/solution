In level10 you can see that the binary use sockets to send a file to the host (on port 6969 found with ltrace) given in parameter,
but it checks before if the file can be accessed by the user using the program,
so you need to exploit access() syscall race condition by using a soft link to a "good" file
and just after launching the program changing the soft link to token file (see script.sh)

on host:
$ nc -l 6969

on guest: 
$ /tmp/script.sh

and if you're lucky:
$ nc -l 6969
