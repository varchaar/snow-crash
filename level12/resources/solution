You can see a script named level12.pl and you can see some filter (every input is put in uppercase and everything after a space is removed. So you need to make an injection whithout lowercase or spaces

For instance you can put a script in /tmp named /tmp/SCRIPT and inject it in the param like so: 
$ curl localhost:4646?x=\`/*/SCRIPT\`&y=bbb
