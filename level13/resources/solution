There is a binary name level13, when running it it outputs :
level13@SnowCrash:~$ ./level13
UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242
Using gdb and disass on level13 you can see a call to getuid and a cmp 
0x08048595 <+9>:	call   0x8048380 <getuid@plt>
0x0804859a <+14>:	cmp    $0x1092,%eax
0x1092 is 4242 in decimal so you can understand that this cmp is the instruction checking if your uid is 4242
So using gdb:
(gdb) break *main+14
(gdb) set $eax=0x1092
And then 
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx

And voil√†.
